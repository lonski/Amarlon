They train in combat, and they generally approach problems head on, weapon drawn.# #Not surprisingly, Fighters are best at fighting of all the classes.

Although they are not skilled in the ways of magic, Fighters can nonetheless use many magic items, including but not limited to magical weapons and armor.# #The Prime Requisite for Fighters is Strength.">

Most Clerics spend their time in mundane forms of service such as preaching and ministering in a temple; but there are those who are called to go abroad from the temple and serve their deity in a more direct way, smiting undead monsters and aiding in the battle against evil and chaos.# #Clerics fight about as well as Thieves, but not as well as Fighters.  They are hardier than Thieves, at least at lower levels, as they are accustomed to physical labor that the Thief would deftly avoid.  Clerics can cast spells of divine nature starting at 2nd level, and they have the power to Turn the Undead, that is, to drive away undead monsters by means of faith alone.# #The Prime Requisite for Clerics is Wisdom.">
